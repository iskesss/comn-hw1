"a drive through the forest"
     by Jordan Bouret

steady down the driveway,
you're dragged on through the night.
your brights are on, you yearn for dawn -
ahead just shapeless forms in sight.

leaves coil down and catch the light,
a gorgeous glow not yours to claim,
aflame but fleeting, a heart still beating -
by pity or by chance they came,
for trite to the trees remains your wake:
CO2; some noise; a name.

no sign of dawn, you'll trundle on â€”
tired tires turning stones, and
scattering leaves: now dry as dirt;
gray as gravel; dead as bones.
